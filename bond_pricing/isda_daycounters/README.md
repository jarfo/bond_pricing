### _ISDA day-count conventions with year-fractions and day-counts_

---

A very minimal ISDA day-count function collection, for the conventions 

- _Actual/360_ 
- _Actual/365_
- _Actual/Actual_
- _Thirty/360_ 
- _ThirtyE/360 (Eurobond)_
- _ThirtyE/360 (ISDA)_

as defined in [the 2006 ISDA definition guidelines](http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/attachments/standalone/2006-isda-definitions.pdf) and [2008 ISDA definitions](https://www.isda.org/2008/12/22/30-360-day-count-conventions/). 

Each day count convention is placed in its own module with both `day_count()` and `year_fraction()` functions, to leverage Python's treatment of modules as first-class objects. 

#### Why?

For a small instrument valuation tool I was working on in Python I needed ISDA-convention day counters, but didn't particularly feel like using Fincad or QuantLib Python bindings purely for day-count convention implementations for an otherwise independent project.
